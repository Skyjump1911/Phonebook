# Phonebook
This is the repository for the phonebook assignment. It is not totally done, as I ended up running out of time on this one. I went to the stem lab as much as time would allow, and tried my best, but unfortunately, I was not able to totally finish it.

What I did get done was some of the basic functions. I think that most of the functions work on their own, but I had some issues figuring out how to use them in the main driver to work with each other.
